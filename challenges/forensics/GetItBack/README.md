# GetItBack
Eval was working on his major assignment report to submit to his teacher when suddenly his computer shut down unexpectedly due to a power outage, and he hadn't saved the report even once. However, instead of starting a new report, Eval chose to spend 4 hours trying to recover the original report from the crash dump file, but ultimately failed. Eval really needs help.
