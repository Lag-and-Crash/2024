# Hardware Lockout 1
I heard hardware tokens are secure so I made one using my Arduino.
Unfortunately I lost the source code and the design files for my project.
Can you help me recover my keys from this firmware image?

Note:
There are two parts to this challenge, but they need not be solved in order.
