# Mockingjay Embeds
A cryptic database leak has emerged from the deep realms of Panem, revealing the texts of the Hunger Games saga hidden within the fabric of a higher dimension. Rumours hint at the use of a certain bge-small-en-v1.5 model crafted by an organization known to outsiders as BAAI. This model has embedded the saga's words into a multidimensional space, where ideas are not bound by pages or paragraphs, but exist in proximity to each other, measured by cosine similarity. However... stringent security measures left my efforts fruitless. Perhaps you could have a try at it... indirectly...
