Google "Takagi Ramen" then there's only a few outlets, go through each of them and look at google street view to see if it's the correct outlet.

A super easy OSINT challenge. I thought the 2.4km challenge was pretty interesting and thought it'd be funny if I shared it with all the CTF players lol.
