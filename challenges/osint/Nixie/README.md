# Nixie

I obtained this image from Flickr in recently. Unfortunately, I lost the initial file which included metadata such as GPS information or hidden annotations in the image. I need to find the author who posted this photo on Flickr and find the artist name, GPS in the original photo

Flag format: LNC24{flag-GPSLat-GPSLong}

Example: Flag: this_is_flag, GPS Latitude: 1_18_35.193_N, GPS Longitude: 105_51_19.0794_E
You should submit: LNC24{this_is_flag-1_18_35.193_N-105_51_19.0794_E}
